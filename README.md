# Titanic-Survival-Exploration

In 1912, the largest ship afloat at the time- RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Of the 2224 passengers and crew abroad 1502 died. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.



In this project, we will explore the training dataset (train) from Kaggle. This dataset contains demographic and passenger information about 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew abroad. The most interesting question here is what features made people more likely to survive the sinking? Based on the available feature information can we build a classification algorithm that can reasonably predict survival?


 
We will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. Start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. For the data analytical approach, we apply the theory of machine learning, to come up with models that can best predict what kinds of passengers are more likely to survive.


Problem: -


Using titanic dataset and machine learning algorithms we try to predict which passengers survived by using features like age, gender, fare etc. We try to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.


Objective: -



We aim to create Machine Learning models that predict whether a passenger would survive in the titanic crash based on features like age, gender, fare etc. This way we try to answer one of the most asked questions of which people were more likely to survive.
